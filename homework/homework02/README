1. What is a computer system?
    A computer system is a system of interconnected hardware and software parts that work together to process data, recieve inputs and produce desired outputs, and perform tasks.

2. What are some of the parts of a computer system?
   Some of the parts that make up a computer system are, the CPU, RAM, motherboard, GPU, SSD

3. What is the difference between a compiled language and an interpreted language?
   A compiled language is converted directly into machine code that can be executed by the processor. Whereas an interpreted language is read line-by-line by another program who calls specific internal functions to execute the code.

4. Is C a compiled language?
   C is a compiled language, although it is slightly different from other compiled languages because in C doesn't enable a virtual OS, meaning the program is compiled to binary then executed by the users computer. 

5. Who invented the C language?
   C was developed by Dennis M. Richie at Bell Labs.

6. How long has C been in use?
   C has been in use for between 56-52 years, as it was developed by Dennis M. Richie between 1969- 1973

7. Is a compiler a translator?
   The compiler is a translator, this is because when someone writes in a high-level language a compiler must take this code and translate it into assembly language.

8. Is an assembler a translator?
   An assember is a translator because after a program is translated into assembly language by a compiler it is taken by an assembler and translated into machine language which can be understood by the machine.

9. What is the command to list out the contents of a directory on a mac terminal window?
   The command to list out the contents of a directory on a mac is "ls", on windows the command is dir.

10. What does the C function atof() do?
   The function atof() is used to convert a string into a floating-point number and represent the converted floating point number to its corresponding double value

11. What are the bottom two layers of a computer system? Give a brief desciption of each.
     The bottom layer of the system is the Digital Logic. This is the actual hardware enabling the computing. This consists of circuits, gates, motherboards, chips and all other physical parts.
     The second to bottom layer is the Control Layer. This layer of the system contains the microcode that uses the hardwre in the layer below it. Microcode can take the form of firmware.

12. What are the three steps of the Von Neumann Architecture?
     1. Fetch -> Get the next instruction
     2. Decode -> Interpret instruction
     3. Execute -> Perform the instructed operation


13. What is the purpose of an ALU?
     The ALU is the Arithmetic Logic Unit. It handles all basic mathematical and logical operations on binary numbers (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, AND, OR etc).


14. What is a register?
     A register is a storage unit inside the CPU which stores an instruction for the program for the CPU to immediately execute.


15. What is one difference between Application software and System software?
   One difference between Application Software and System Software is that Application Software is written for people, while System Software is written for computers.


16. Is the phrase cmp rdi, rsi machine language?
   No, the phrase "cmp rdi, rsi" is not machine language. The phrase is actually in Assembly language.


17. How many buses are included in the system bus?
   There are three buses included in the system bus. These buses are: the data bus, the address bus, and the control bus.


18. What is the decimal value of 10010111 (base 2)?
    In order to figure out the decimal value of 10010111, we identity where each 1 bit is, write down their powers of two, then add them up. So, we 
   would do: 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^4 + 2^7 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 16 + 128 = 151


19. What is the decimal value of 11111111 (base 2)?
    In order to figure out the decimal value of 11111111, we identity where each 1 bit is, write down their powers of two, then add them up. So, we 
   would do: 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255


20. What is the largest unsigned integer value that will fit into 16 bits?
    The largest unsigned integer value that will fit into 16 bits is 1111111111111111, or 65,535
